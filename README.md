# MINATO: Massive bINaries Analysis TOols
Python tools for the analysis of massive binary stars

Version 1.0:
- Spectral analysis (span): It allows to fit the spectra of binary stars simultaneously with synthetic spectra. Effective temperatures, log surface gravities, rotational velocities, He/H ratios, and the light ratio is returned.


Future additions:
- Radial velocity measurements
- Time series analysis
- Spectral analysis
- SED fitting
- Spectral classification
